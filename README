RepurposeML: a python package for reproducible ml based drug repurposing / the curse of data imbalance / investigating the effect of data imbalance of ml based methods in drug repurposing 

- many methods were proposed, almost none provide code / model used in the study
- to improve reproducibility
- AUC widely used, albeit its limitations in characterizing predictability of ml based drug repurposing
- repurposing highly imbalanced problem
- even simple as knn can do good
- inverse correlation interpretability accuracy
- knn se + target + chem svm
- effect of data imbalance (size & cv insignifincant)
